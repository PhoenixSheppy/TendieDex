*Shh don't tell anyone, but I'm making a chicken tender rating website.*

I've eaten way too many chicken tenders in my lifetime to not keep record of who has the best, and who has the worst.
Now, it's my time to write up an "index" of chicken tender rankings based on flavor, texture, visual appeal, and restaurant characteristics.

I'm rewriting this in typescript + tailwind (because pretty)!
